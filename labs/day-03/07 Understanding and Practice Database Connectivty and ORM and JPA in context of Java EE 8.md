**Answers for Exercise 1: Database Connectivity and ORM**

- **What is an ER model, and why is it important in database design?**  
  The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is a blueprint for designing a database. It identifies the key entities, their attributes, and how they relate to each other. By mapping out these relationships visually, developers can create a logical and efficient database structure.
- **Can you explain what a Primary Key (PK) is and why it's crucial in a database?**  
  A **Primary Key** is like the unique identifier of a row in a database table. It guarantees that each entry is distinct and serves as the main identifier for retrieving or linking data.
- **What exactly is a Foreign Key (FK), and how does it relate to other tables?**  
  A **Foreign Key** acts as a reference between two tables by linking one tableâ€™s column(s) to the Primary Key in another. It ensures data consistency by enforcing relationships, like connecting orders to customers.
- **What is a connection pool, and how does it help improve application performance?**  
  A **connection pool** is like a database connection bank where reusable connections are stored. Instead of opening and closing a new connection for every query, applications borrow from the pool, speeding up operations and conserving resources. This improves performance by reducing connection open/close overhead and also helps manage the number of connections to the database, so improving scalability. Note, we will learn about object pooling in the context of Java EE in the upcoming days which is a very similar concept.
- **What is a datasource, and how does it simplify working with databases?**  
  A **datasource** is a shortcut for connecting to a database. It hides the complexity of managing connections and pools behind a simple, standardized interface, making it easier to interact with the database.
- **Why do we need `persistence.xml`, and what role does it play in JPA?**  
  The **`persistence.xml`** file is a central configuration information of a JPA setup. It tells the application how to connect to the database, which JPA provider to use, and which entities to manage. Without it, the persistence context cannot function.

**Answers for Exercise 2: Manual Transaction Management**

1.  **What is the purpose of the `JpaDemoBean` class in the project?**  
    The `JpaDemoBean` class is a managed bean used to demonstrate JPA functionalities, such as persisting, retrieving, updating, and deleting `Customer` entities in the database.
2.  **What is the role of the `@Named` annotation in the `JpaDemoBean` class?**  
    The `@Named` annotation makes the `JpaDemoBean` accessible in EL (Expression Language) expressions, allowing it to be used in JSF (JavaServer Faces) pages.
3.  **Why is the `@RequestScoped` annotation used in the `JpaDemoBean` class?**  
    The `@RequestScoped` annotation ensures that the bean is created and destroyed with each HTTP request, making it suitable for short-lived operations like database updates triggered by user actions.
4.  **How does the `@PersistenceContext` annotation interact with the `EntityManager`?**  
    The `@PersistenceContext` annotation injects an `EntityManager` instance, which is used to interact with the persistence context for performing CRUD operations on entities.
5.  **What is the function of the `UserTransaction` resource in this class?**  
    The `UserTransaction` resource manages transactions explicitly. It allows the bean to define transaction boundaries (e.g., begin and commit transactions) instead of relying on container-managed transactions.
6.  **How does the `updateDatabase` method manage database transactions?**  
    The `updateDatabase` method begins a transaction using `userTransaction.begin()`, performs multiple database operations (persist, find, update, and remove), and then commits the transaction using `userTransaction.commit()`.
7.  **What entities are manipulated in the `updateDatabase` method?**  
    The `updateDatabase` method manipulates three `Customer` entities:

    - `customer`: Created and persisted, but then removed later in the transaction.
    - `customer2`: Created and persisted.
    - `customer3`: Retrieved using `entityManager.find()` and then updated.

8.  **What exception handling mechanism is implemented in the `updateDatabase` method?**  
    The method handles various exceptions (`HeuristicMixedException`, `HeuristicRollbackException`, `IllegalStateException`, `NotSupportedException`, `RollbackException`, `SecurityException`, and `SystemException`) to catch transaction-related issues and ensure stability. If an exception occurs, the method logs the error and returns an error state ("error").
9.  **Why is the `entityManager.remove(customer)` call made, and what is its purpose?**  
    The `entityManager.remove(customer)` call is used to delete the `customer` entity from the database as part of demonstrating the `remove` operation within a transaction.
10. **How does this class demonstrate the use of JPA for database persistence and retrieval?**  
    This class shows how to use JPA to:

    - Persist entities using `entityManager.persist()`.
    - Retrieve an entity by its primary key using `entityManager.find()`.
    - Update an entity by modifying its fields within a transaction.
    - Remove an entity using `entityManager.remove()`.
    - Handle database operations within explicit transaction boundaries using `UserTransaction`.

**Answers for Exercise 3: Relationship Mapping in JPA**

- **How is the `@OneToOne` relationship between `Customer` and `LoginInfo` defined in the `Customer` entity?**  
  The `@OneToOne` relationship is defined in the `Customer` entity using the `@OneToOne(mappedBy = "customer")` annotation, where `mappedBy` indicates that the `customer` field in the `LoginInfo` entity owns the relationship. This means the `LoginInfo` entity contains the foreign key column for the relationship.
- **What does the `@ManyToMany` annotation in the `Order` and `Item` entities signify, and how is the relationship configured?**  
  The `@ManyToMany` annotation signifies a many-to-many relationship between `Order` and `Item`. In the `Order` entity, the relationship is configured using the `@JoinTable` annotation, which defines the join table `ORDER_ITEMS` and specifies `ORDER_ID` and `ITEM_ID` as the foreign key columns. The `mappedBy` attribute in the `Item` entity indicates that the relationship is owned by the `Order` entity.
- **How is the `@OneToMany` relationship between `Customer` and `Order` entities modeled, and what does the `mappedBy` attribute indicate?**  
  The `@OneToMany` relationship is modeled in the `Customer` entity with the annotation `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer")`. The `mappedBy` attribute specifies that the `customer` field in the `Order` entity owns the relationship, meaning the `Order` entity contains the foreign key column `CUSTOMER_ID`.
- **What role does the `@JoinTable` annotation play in the `Order` entity for the `items` field?**  
  The `@JoinTable` annotation in the `Order` entity defines the join table `ORDER_ITEMS` that facilitates the many-to-many relationship between `Order` and `Item`. It specifies how the foreign key columns (`ORDER_ID` and `ITEM_ID`) map the relationship between the two entities.
- **How does the `@ManyToOne` relationship between `Order` and `Customer` entities work, and how is the foreign key defined?**  
  The `@ManyToOne` relationship in the `Order` entity is defined using the `@ManyToOne` annotation and the `@JoinColumn(name = "CUSTOMER_ID")` annotation. This indicates that each `Order` is associated with one `Customer`, and the foreign key `CUSTOMER_ID` in the `ORDERS` table references the primary key of the `CUSTOMERS` table.

**Answers for Exercise 4: Composite Primary Keys in JPA**

- **How does the `@IdClass` annotation in the `OrderItem` class define a composite primary key?**  
  The `@IdClass` annotation in the `OrderItem` class specifies that the primary key consists of multiple fields (`orderId` and `itemId`). The annotation links the `OrderItem` class to the `OrderItemPK` class, which provides a composite key definition.
- **What is the purpose of the `OrderItemPK` class, and how does it support the `OrderItem` entity?**  
  The `OrderItemPK` class serves as the composite primary key for the `OrderItem` entity. It implements the `Serializable` interface and defines the fields `orderId` and `itemId`. It includes `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to ensure the correct behavior of the composite key during persistence operations.
- **How does the `EntityManager.find()` method handle composite primary keys in the `CompositePrimaryKeyDemoBean` class?**  
  The `EntityManager.find()` method is used to retrieve an `OrderItem` entity based on its composite primary key. The key is represented by an instance of `OrderItemPK`, which is passed as the second argument to the `find()` method.
- **What role do the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods play in the `OrderItemPK` class?**  
  The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods ensure that instances of `OrderItemPK` are compared correctly based on their field values (`orderId` and `itemId`). These methods are crucial for JPA to identify entities with composite primary keys in collections or when performing operations like `find()` or `merge()`.
- **Why is the `@PersistenceContext` annotation used in the `CompositePrimaryKeyDemoBean` class?**  
  The `@PersistenceContext` annotation is used to inject an `EntityManager` instance into the `CompositePrimaryKeyDemoBean` class. This allows the bean to interact with the persistence context for performing database operations, such as retrieving an entity using a composite primary key.
